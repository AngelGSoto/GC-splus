** Step 4: Globular Cluster Photometry
*** Objective
Perform aperture photometry of globular clusters using the calculated zero-points.

*** Main Script
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python Splus_photometry_final.py
#+END_SRC

- TAP_1_J_MNRAS_3444_gc.csv → Globular cluster catalog (Taylor et al. 2017)
- all_fields_zero_points_splus_format.csv → Zero-points for all fields
- SPLUS images for each field and filter

*** Photometry Parameters
- Apertures: 3, 4, 5, 6 arcsec (diameter)
- Background annulus: 6-9 arcsec
- Minimum SNR: 3

*** Outputs
- CenAXX_gc_photometry.csv → Individual field results
- all_fields_gc_photometry_merged.csv → Final combined catalog

*** Background correction
Correcting the variable background of the galaxy is crucial for obtaining
accurate photometry of the globular clusters in Centaurus A. This step was
suggested by Ana after reviewing the initial results.
We implement background subtraction using Photutils' Background2D, which
models the variable background by dividing the image into boxes and fitting
a background model in each box. This approach is more robust than a simple
unsharp mask for this application.

The script based on the last one is:


#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python Splus_photometry_final_bg_mask.py
#+END_SRC

**** Key parameters:

    box_size = 50 pixels :: Size of the box for background estimation. This should be
    larger than typical globular clusters but smaller than the background structures
    of the galaxy.

    filter_size = 3 :: Size of the filter to apply to the background map.

    sigma_clip = SigmaClip(sigma=3.0) :: Sigma clipping parameters for excluding sources.

    snr_threshold = 2 :: Signal-to-noise ratio for source detection in masking.

    npixels = 5 :: Minimum number of connected pixels for source detection.

    dilate_size = 11 :: Size of dilation kernel for expanding source masks.

**** Implementation:
The background subtraction is performed for each filter image before doing
aperture photometry. We create a mask to exclude bright objects (stars and
clusters) when estimating the background.

**** Verification:
We generate verification images for one
filter per field (to avoid too many files) showing:

*** Aperture correction

By suggestion of Juan we need to do aperture correction because we are using aperture fixed
to do the photometry. Agrement we Juan this is because the image or filter are change for instance
different seeing. I thin as wel this correction is necesary because we only have the
narrow band filter form T80S (splus) and for broad band we will use the magnitude form the
Taylor catalog which is based on Decam and used PSF photometry.

The script that made the aperture photometry now include this correction and is:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  python ../Programs/Splus_photometry_final_bg_mask_aper_correction.py
#+END_SRC

Note that we are using the same star the references that previousle used to estimate the
zeropoints to to this aperture correction.

*** Additional Tests and Methodological Comparisons

I identified slight discrepancies between my photometry
results and the Taylor catalog reference magnitudes,
which led to a series of methodological tests to optimize the approach.

**** Approach 1: No Additional Background Subtraction

Recognizing that the S-PLUS images are already pre-processed
with background subtraction, I initially implemented a
simplified pipeline without additional background correction.
This version only applied aperture corrections to the photometry:

: Splus_photometry_final_aper_correction.py

**** Approach 2: Galaxy Background Residual Modeling

Considering the complex background structure of Centaurus A,
I implemented a specialized routine to model and subtract residual
background patterns. This approach specifically addresses the
challenges of working with already background-subtracted images
of extended galaxies:

: Splus_photometry_final_bg_modeling_aper_correction.py

While this improved the results, some discrepancies with Taylor's
broadband magnitudes persisted.

**** Approach 3: Consistent Methodology Approach

The most significant insight came from recognizing the importance
of methodological consistency. Since the reference stars used for
zero-point determination were measured without additional corrections,
I implemented a simplified approach that applies identical methodology
to both reference stars and science targets:

: Splus_photometry_final_simple.py

This consistent approach yielded the most physically meaningful
results with better agreement with reference catalogs.

**** Next Steps and Future Tests

The logical progression would be to implement the same correction
algorithms used for the globular cluster photometry to the reference
star photometry process. This would ensure complete methodological
consistency throughout the entire calibration pipeline, potentially
further improving the accuracy and precision of the final photometric
measurements.

* Execution Instructions
** Initial Setup
1. Ensure correct directory structure
2. Verify all SPLUS fields are available
3. Confirm location of globular cluster catalog

** Execution Order
1. Extract Gaia XP spectra → Step 1
2. Generate synthetic photometry → Step 2
3. Calculate zero-points → Step 3
4. Run cluster photometry → Step 4

** Complete Reprocessing Command
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Step 1: Extract XP spectra
python ../Programs/extract_splus_gaia_xp_final.py

# Step 2: Synthetic photometry (run in spectra directory)
for D in ./gaia_spectra_CenA*; do 
    if [ -d "$D" ]; then 
        cd "$D"; 
        for f in *.dat; do 
            python ../../programs/symphotometry.py ${f%.dat} --filters SPLUS21 --name Ref --savefig; 
        done; 
        cd ..; 
    fi; 
done

# Step 3: Zero-point calculation
python ../Programs/ZeroPoints_calculations.py

# Step 4: Cluster photometry
python Splus_photometry_final.py

* Troubleshooting
** Common Issues
*** SPLUS Images Not Found
- Verify directory structure
- Ensure images follow correct naming convention

*** No Zero-points for a Field
- Verify field is in all_fields_zero_points_splus_format.csv
- Check zero-point calculation for that specific field

*** Sources Near Edge
- Script automatically flags with 99.0 for edge sources
- Consider using smaller aperture for these sources

** Result Interpretation
- Magnitude values of 99.0: Source detected but not properly measured
- NaN values: Source not in field
- SNR < 3: Measurements considered unreliable

* Results and Products
** Generated Catalogs
- all_fields_gc_photometry_merged.csv → Main catalog with all measurements
- CenAXX_gc_photometry.csv → Individual field results

** Output Formats
- CSV with columns organized by filter and aperture
- Special values: 99.0 for failed measurements, NaN for out-of-field sources

** Quality Analysis
- Script includes statistical summary of data quality
- Reports number of valid measurements per filter and aperture
- Provides average SNR and average magnitude per filter

* Technical Notes
** System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Memory: ≥8GB RAM recommended for processing all fields
- Storage: ~50GB for SPLUS images + results

** Python Dependencies
- astropy, numpy, pandas, photutils, tqdm, matplotlib

** Estimated Execution Time
- Complete run: 6-12 hours (hardware dependent)
- Per field: 15-30 minutes
